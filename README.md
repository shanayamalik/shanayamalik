👋 Hi, I’m @shanayamalik!

👩‍🎓 I'm majoring in Computer Science at the University of California, Santa Cruz. 

🖥️ I’m a Software Engineering Intern at Medtronic, where I'm working on simulating blood glucose calibration in the continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensor. 

⏳ I've volunteered 1675+ hours, earning awards from President Biden and the California State Assembly. 

🧘‍♀️ In my free time, I like to go hiking, meditate, and discover new milk tea places.
