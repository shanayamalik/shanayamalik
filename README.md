👋 Hi, I’m @shanayamalik.

👩‍🎓 I'm majoring in Computer Science at the University of California, Santa Cruz. 

📚 I wrote and sold copies of my first book, titled "A New World," at the age of eleven. I'm currently working on a novel that highlights the life lessons learned by 60 people over the age of 60, which is set to publish in Spring 2024. 

⏳ I've volunteered 1675+ hours, earning awards from President Biden, the California State Assembly, and the Milpitas Board of Education.

🖥️ I’m working on my startup, https://www.applyto.jobs, a web-app that maximizing users' chances of securing a job through using LLMs to tailor a resume and cover letter to each position. If you're interested in interning or collaborating, feel free to reach out!

🧘‍♀️ In my free time, you might find me walking in nature, attending a San Jose Sharks game, or watching reality shows on Netflix. 

📧 If you're looking to get in touch, you can contact me at simalik@ucsc.edu, or through my site, https://shanayamalik.github.io/portfolio/.
