👋 Hi, I’m @shanayamalik.

👩‍🎓 I’m majoring in Computer Science at the University of California, Santa Cruz. The programming languages I’m currently learning are Python, JavaScript, Assembly RISC-V, and C. My past coursework also includes Discrete Math, Probability Theory, Calc I-III, and A.I Ethics. 

📚 I wrote and sold copies of my first book, titled "A New World," at the age of eleven. I'm currently working on a novel that highlights the life lessons learned by 60 people over the age of 60, which is set to publish in Spring 2024. 

🖥️ I’m working on my startup, https://www.applyto.jobs, a web-app that primarily uses Python, HTML, and LLM to customize resumes and cover letters, maximizing users' chances of securing a job. If you're interested in interning or collaborating, feel free to reach out!
