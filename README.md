#👋 Hi, I’m @shanayamalik!

👩‍🎓 I'm majoring in Computer Science at the University of California, Santa Cruz. 

🖥️ My prior experience includes a Software Engineering Internship at Medtronic, an Artificial Intelligence Internship at Secomind, and a Machine Learning Research Internship at San Jose State University. 

⏳ I've volunteered 1675+ hours, earning awards from President Biden and the California State Assembly. 

🧘‍♀️ In my free time, I like to go hiking, meditate, and try new boba places.
