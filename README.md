🎓 Hi, I'm @shanayamalik! I'm pursuing a Master's in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at UC Berkeley, with a concentration in Signal Processing & Wireless Communication. 

📚 I'm currently a Software Engineering Intern at Siemens, where I'm automating smart building solutions using the Building X cloud platform and open APIs. 

☕ In my spare time, you can find me watching new shows, hiking, or trying different coffee places.
