👋 Hi, I’m @shanayamalik.

👩‍🎓 I'm majoring in Computer Science at the University of California, Santa Cruz. 

📚 I wrote and sold copies of my first book, titled "A New World," at the age of eleven.  

⏳ I've volunteered 1675+ hours, earning awards from President Biden, the California State Assembly, and the Milpitas Board of Education.

🖥️ I’m working on my project, https://www.applyto.jobs, a web-app that maximizing users' chances of securing a job through using LLMs to tailor a resume and cover letter to each position.

🧘‍♀️ In my free time, I like spending time in nature, attending San Jose Sharks games, or watching shows on Netflix.
