👋 Hi, I’m @shanayamalik!
👩‍🎓 I’m majoring in Computer Science at the University of California, Santa Cruz. 

🌱 The programming languages I’m currently learning are Python, JavaScript, Assembly RISC-V, and C. My past coursework also includes Discrete Math, Probability Theory, Calc I-III, and A.I Ethics. 

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on applyto.jobs, my web-app that primarily uses Python, HTML, and LLM to customize resumes and cover letters, maximizing users' chances of securing a job (entirely for free!)

📧 Feel free to contact me at simalik@ucsc.edu.
